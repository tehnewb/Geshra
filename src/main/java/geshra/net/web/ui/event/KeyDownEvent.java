/**
 * Represents a keyboard event sent from the client-side.
 * Models a key press or release including modifier states and optional metadata.
 *
 * <p>The {@code key} field maps to a predefined enum of keyboard keys,
 * while {@code down} reflects whether the event is a press ({@code true}) or release ({@code false}).
 *
 * <p>Modifier keys such as Ctrl, Alt, Shift, and Meta are encoded using bit flags
 * in {@code modifierFlags}, and {@code repeated} indicates whether the key was
 * auto-repeated due to being held.
